\section{Proof of Theorem~\ref{th:corr}}
\label{sec:proofs-algorithm}

As explained in Section~\ref{ssec:corr}, $I$-soundness, the polynomial space bound, and the part of strong completeness that refers to not engaging in fruitless explorations follow directly from definitions. In the following, we focus on $I$-completeness and then optimality. For the sake of the proof's readability, we will omit all local states of the algorithm's definition during the proof. Therefore, we consider programs where we can describe all their events.

%\textcolor{red}{The proofs are written when no local state was added, as otherwise I have to assign to every history a local state (randomness is allowed? in that case not one but a set of local states...)}
%%As we are going to prove the completeness of algorithm \ref{algorithm:stmc}, the first property we want to prove is its equivalence with its recursive counterpart, \ref{algorithm:stmc2}. Here, line \ref{algorithm:stmc:inner_loop} refers to
