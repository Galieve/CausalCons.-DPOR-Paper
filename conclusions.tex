\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}

We have presented efficient stateless model checking algorithms with DPOR for transactional programs running under standard isolation levels. These algorithms are defined by considering a generic schema, called swapping-based algorithms, parametrized by the isolation level. Our algorithms are sound and complete, and have a polynomial space complexity. Additionally, we have identified a class of isolation levels, including Read Committed (RC) and Causal Consistency (CC), for which our algorithms are strongly optimal, and we have shown that swapping-based algorithms cannot be strongly optimal in the case of the stronger levels of Snapshot Isolation (SI) and Serializability (SER) (but just optimal). It is interesting to observe that for the isolation levels we considered, there is an intriguing coincidence between the existence of a strongly optimal swapping-based algorithm and the complexity for checking if a given history is consistent with that level. Indeed, for both RC and CC, there exist strongly optimal algorithms
and checking consistency is polynomial time, and for both SI and SER, there are no strongly optimal swapping-based algorithms and checking consistency is NP-complete. An interesting question to investigate is the characterization of isolation levels for which strong optimality can be ensured (under the swapping-based paradigm), and whether this characterization is related to the complexity of checking consistency.
