\subsection{Soundness}



\begin{theorem}
Algorithm \ref{algorithm:optimal-instantiated} is sound.
\begin{proof}
We want to prove that any computable path is formed by sound ordered histories. For doing so, we will do an induction on the number of steps this path has. The base case, when the path is empty, is due to the initial state. There, the history has to be $\emptyset$, which is consistent. Thus, let's prove the inductive step, assuming that in any computable path of length at most $n$ every ordered history is consistent. Let be $p$ a computable path of length $n+1$ and $h$ its last history. 

As $p \setminus \{h\}$ is a computable path of length $n$, every history is consistent; so in particular the immediate predecessor of $h$ in $p$: $h_p$. Let $a = \nextEvent(h_p)$, which is always a $\so \cup \wro$-maximal event. If $a$ is not a $\iread$ event and $h = h_p \oplus e$, by definition \ref{def:causally-extensible} we know $h$ is consistent. Analogously, if $a$ is a $\iread$ event and $h = h_p \oplus \wro(r, t)$ for some $t \in h_p$, by $\validWrites$'s definition we know $h$ is consistent. Finally, if $h = \swap(h_p, r, t)$ for some event $r$ and transaction $t$, as by corollary \ref{corollary:soundness-swapped}, $\genericProtocol(h_p, r, t)$ is coherent with each time a $\textsc{exploreSwaps}$ call is done and is satisfied, $h$ is consistent.
